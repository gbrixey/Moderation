This is an app designed to help the user track and moderate their drinking habits.

The app shows a basic calendar with a column for each day.
The amount of alcohol consumed on a given day is shown in emojis, each of which represents 1 mL of pure alcohol.
Transparent emojis represent the amount of alcohol allowed on the present day and future days, based on the rules defined in the settings menu.
If no more alcohol can be consumed on a given day, the ðŸš« emoji appears.
