This is an app designed to help the user track and moderate their drinking habits.

The app shows a basic calendar with a column for each day.
The amount of alcohol consumed on a given day is shown in emojis, each of which represents 1 mL of pure alcohol.
Transparent emojis represent the amount of alcohol allowed on the present day and future days.
If no more alcohol can be consumed on a given day, the ðŸš« emoji appears.

The rules are:
- No drinking on consecutive days
- No more than 60 mL of pure alcohol per day
- No more than 140 mL of pure alcohol per seven days

These rules are fixed, but could be made configurable in the future.
